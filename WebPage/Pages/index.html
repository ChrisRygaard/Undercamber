      Undercamber&trade; is a Java-based software test automation framework, with these advantages:
      <ul>
         <li>An automatically generated hierarchical GUI for quickly selecting an ad-hoc subset of tests to be run, and fully automated testing without a GUI,</li>
         <li>Simple programming via a traditional API to support unique or unusual testing strategies,</li>
         <li>Powerful and simple support for running a test's prerequisites, including skipping setups that have already been performed prior to execution (such as from a previous run), and</li>
         <li>Support for testing different versions of the Unit Under Test (UUT) and different versions of JVMs in a single run.</li>
         <li>Simple and effective concurrency control.</li>
         <li>Short learning curve</li>
      </ul>

      Undercamber has a unique self-configuring GUI that the tester can use to quickly select and run an ad-hoc subset of tests:<p>

      <h1>Undercamber Features</h1>
      Undercamber addresses several aspects of testing that are unique to an agile environment, including:

      <h2 id="SubsetSelection">Ad Hoc Subset Selection</h2>

      When working in a customer-driven environment, requirements, goals, and priorities can change.  Sometimes rapidly.  A developer might be working on
      one part of the product in the morning, and working on a completely different part of the product that afternoon.<p>

      To support such development, the programmer needs to quickly select a subset of the full regression test suite to perform tests that are relevant
      to the work at hand.  For example:
      <ul>
         <li>When working with code to validate user input, the developer does not want to waste time running tests to verify persistence.</li>
         <li>When working on an interface to third-party libraries, the developer does not want to waste time running tests to validate user input.</li>
      </ul>

      For a test framework to properly support an agile environment, it must be easy for a developer to quickly select an appropriate subset of the tests
      to run, and then re-use that subset of tests quickly and painlessly.  Toward this goal, Undercamber presents a GUI with a hierarchical tree of tests as shown above.<p>

      The GUI is automatically created, updated, and configured completely automatically.<p>

      <a href="#top">Return to top</a>

      <h2 id="SelfConfiguration">Self-Configuration</h2>

      When adding, updating, or removing features in the end product, the test suite should be updated accordingly.  When a developer updates the test
      source code, the test automation framework should automatically configure itself without intervention from the developer.<p>

      Undercamber is self-configuring.  It deduces the test structure from the test code, and uses that to drive the GUI.  Consider this test code:
      <pre>
            public class MyTests
               implements TestUnit
            {
               public void runTest( TestManager testManager )
                  throws Throwable
               {
                  boolean verify;
                  MyBank  bank;

                  verify = testManager.initialize();
                  if ( verify )
                  {
                     bank = new MyBank();
                  }
                  else
                  {
                     bank = null;
                  }
                  testManager.addSubtest( tm -> testAccountCreation(tm,bank) );
                  testManager.addSubtest( tm -> testDeposit(tm,bank) );
               }

               void testAccountCreation( TestManager testManager, MyBank bank )
                  throws Throwable
               {
                  boolean verify;

                  verify = testManager.initialize();
                  if ( verify )
                  {
                     bank.createAccount( "Bill" );
                  }
               }

               void testDeposit( TestManager testManager, MyBank bank )
                  throws Throwable
               {
                  boolean verify;

                  verify = testManager.initialize();
                  if ( verify )
                  {
                     bank.deposit( "Bill", 100 );
                  }
                  testManager.addSubtest( tm -> testWithdraw(tm,bank) );
               }

               void testWithdraw( TestManager testManager, MyBank bank )
                  throws Throwable
               {
                  boolean verify;

                  verify = testManager.initialize();
                  if ( verify )
                  {
                     bank.withdraw( "Bill", 50 );
                  }
               }
            }</pre>

      With the above test code, Undercamber will automatically produce this GUI without any scripting, configuration, or annotations:

      <h3 id="TestAutomation">Test Automation</h3>

      In an agile environment, a test engineer needs to automate the tests, without any user intervention and without a GUI.<p>

      Although Undercamber can be run with a GUI, it also has a variety of techniques to quickly and easily specify subsets
      of tests for automated execution.  Once the subset of tests specified, there is very little effort to maintain the list
      as tests are added, updated and removed from the system.  In most cases it is automatic and there is zero effort to
      maintain the list.<p>

      These subsets of tests (or all of the tests) can be easily invoked from the operating system command-line without
      displaying the GUI.<p>

      <a href="#top">Return to top</a>

      <h2 id="API">API Programming</h2>

      As illustrated above, Undercamber is programmed entirely through a simple API, without configuration files and without
      annotations.  This allows the test developer to create testing strategies that are not anticipated by the framework.<p>

      By using an API, unusual testing strategies are easy to program:
      <ul>
         <li>Testing in a loop uses ordinary Java looping techniques (such as <tt>for</tt>, <tt>do</tt>, and <tt>while</tt> loops.)</li>
         <li>Optional testing can be implemented using ordinary Java conditional programming (such as <tt>if</tt> blocks)</li>
         <li>Method calls can be made wherever needed</li>
         <li>Any and all other Java programming techniques are available to the test developer</li>
      </ul>

      Java developers are already familiar with Java techniques (obviously), so the Undercamber learning curve is quite short.
      Developers do not need to learn a new annotation scheme, and do not need to learn a new configuration file format.

      <h3 id="TightIntegration">Tight Integration Into the Development Workflow</h3>

      Because Undercamber is programmed with ordinary Java, it will naturally integrate well with any IDE or automation tools.<p>

      <a href="#top">Return to top</a>

      <h2 id="Prerequisites">Test Setup and Prerequisites</h2>

      In all but the simplest scenarios, a software test will require some setup prior to execution.<p>

      In Undercamber, such a prerequisite is just another ordinary test.  The only difference is that it
      must be completed before its dependent test is run.  Because a prerequisite is itself just another
      test, a prerequisite can have its own prerequisites.<p>

      Undercamber has several types of prerequisites, some of which are implicit in the test structure, and other which are
      explicitly specified by the test developer.  This makes it easy to construct sophisticated networks of setup functions and
      prerequisites, and such a network requires very little maintenance as tests are added and removed from the system.  In most
      cases, it is fully automatic.<p>

      <h3>Dynamic Prerequisites</h3>

      Undercamber supports dynamic prerequisites, that may or may not be run depending on whether the prerequisites are satisfied
      prior to running Undercamber.<p>

      Consider a test system that validates database access, but setting up the database is very time consuming.  To automate the test
      process, it makes sense to set up the database within the test system.  However, it also makes sense to skip the database setup
      if the database already exists.  In Undercamber, it is easy to write code to check the presence of the database before declaring
      that the setup step must be run.<p>

      <a href="#top">Return to top</a><p>

      <h2 id="MultipleVersions">Test multiple versions of the UUT</h2>

      The unique architecture of Undercamber fully supports testing
      <ul>
         <li>Multiple versions of the Unit Under Test (UUT), and</li>
         <lI>Multiple versions of JVMs</li>
      </ul>

      all within a single test run.<p>
