# Undercamber

This is the Undercamber&trade; test framework.  It was built to address frustration with existing test systems.  In particular, it addresses these issues:
   - Other systems require implementing and tuning byzantine annotations.
   - Running an ad-hoc subset of the tests in other frameworks requires either re-programming the tests or a mind-meld with the annotations.
   - In other systems, adding and removing tests can require tuning and re-tuning annotations.
   - In other systems, setting up prerequisites for each test can be tricky, and it can be difficult to skip prerequisites that have been satisified prior to execution.
   - Other systems assume certain testing strategies, and it is difficult to implement a strategy not anticipated by the framework.
   - When using other systems it can be difficult to test on multiple JVMs.
   - In many other systems the order of execution is not well defined.
   - There can be a long learing curve with other test frameworks.

The unique architecture of Undercamber&trade; addresses all of these issues and others with a unique but surprisingly simple approach.  To begin using Undercamber&trade;, see the User's Guide in Documents/UserGuide/UndercamberUsersGuide.docx
