Undercamber 0.2 Release Notes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.1

(Initial release)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2

Fixes
-----

    option.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.3

Fixes
-----

(1) TestSetBuilder.setClassName( String ) has been put back into the API.

(2) build.xml has been updated to properly compile the sample code.

Updates
-------

(1) The first pass (the discovery pass) runs in a separate process.  This allows the various UUTs
    to be completely decoupled, which in turn resolves potential execution and run-time conflicts.

(2) The sequence of events in the execution is changed:

    (2a) CompletionCallback.testComplete( TestData ) is called at the end of each test set in the
         second pass, instead of after all tests are complete.

    (2b) Requirement.testComplete( TestData ) is called at the end of each test set in the second
         pass, instead of after all tests are complete.

(3) The argument in CompletionCallback.testComplete(...) has changed from a list of TestData
    objects to a single TestData object.

(4) TestSetBuilder.setClass( Class ) is deprecated because it can cause coupling between the
    different test sets.

(5) A "Collapse All" button and an "Expand All" button have been added to the selection window and
    the results window.

(6) Undercamber.getVersion() is now a static method.

Notes
-----

(1) When Undercamber is first run after upgrading to this release from a previous release, some
    exceptions will be thrown at startup, and the selections in the initial selection window will
    be lost, but Undercamber will then proceed to completion normally.  Undercamber will run
    normally on subsequent runs.
